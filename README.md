# MagicWorld-ScreenSaver-OSX
Use OpenGL and ScreenSaver framework to build a OSX screensaver.
For now it only renders a triangle with scaling, translation, rotation with random coloring progression.
I expect to later render some meshes or maybe using assimb to load some fancy object.
Anyway,the goal is to give people more choice on mac os screensaver since it's currently very limited.
